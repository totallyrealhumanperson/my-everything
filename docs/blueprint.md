# **App Name**: TweetShell

## Core Features:

- Tweet Composer: Simple form with a textarea for composing tweets.
- Submit Button: Button to trigger tweet submission via API.
- API Integration: API integration to post the tweet to Twitter/X (single account only).
- AI-Powered Content Filter: A tool that detects potentially offensive or harmful language and provides suggestions for rephrasing before posting. This is optional and should be implemented via generative AI (such as OpenAI).
- Confirmation Display: Confirmation message after successfully posting a tweet.
- Character Counter: Character counter to indicate remaining characters (max 280).

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Strong blue (#3498db) evokes trust and stability, necessary because the app is linked to the user's social media.
- Background color: Light gray (#ecf0f1), nearly white, provides a neutral, clean backdrop, so the UI feels light and effortless.
- Accent color: Soft purple (#9b59b6) complements the primary blue and provides gentle highlights and visual interest.
- Font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for both body and headline, to promote legibility and modern feel.
- Use minimalistic vector icons for the submit button and content filtering suggestions.
- Clean and simple layout with a focus on the tweet composer. Prominent submit button.
- Subtle fade-in/out animation for confirmation messages and error notifications.
